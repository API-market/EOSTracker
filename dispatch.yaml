dispatch:

  # Deploy this file to update routings for this service
  # $ gcloud config set project open-rights-exchange 
  # $ gcloud app deploy dispatch.yaml  

  # Default service serves the typical web resources and all static resources.
  # - url: "*/favicon.ico"
  #   service: web

  # Default service serves simple hostname request.
  # - url: "openrights.exchange/*"
  #   service: default
  # If we later add a website at www. ...
  # - url: "www.openrights.exchange/*"
  #   service: web

  #!!!! Important
  # Updating the dispatch file affects all apps running under open-rights-exchange project
  # We should always have a single dispatch file to use for repos in the same project - otherwise we risk overwriting routes
  # Use the following dispatch file (and make updates to it instead of this file)
